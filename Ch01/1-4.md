### Solutions

1. Yes, detected by 56 engines. The basic information returned by VT includes:
    ```

    File size	36.00 KB (36864 bytes)
    PEiD packer	Microsoft Visual C++
    ```
2. The file is unpacked as can be seen through PEiD and Basic information extracted through VT.
3. Compiled on 2019-08-30 22:26:59
4. The imports in the file are: Kernel32.dll, Advapi32.dll, msvcrt.dll. These imports suggest that the malware filel might be capable of manipulation of files, registry.
5. The following can be used as HBI:
    - \system32\wupdmgr.exe
    - http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe
    - \winup.exe
6. Yes, the resource is named BIN. Upon analysing the Hex stream, it can be suggested that a Directory is created, the file winup.exe is copied and downloaded from the given link as wupdmgr.exe within system32 directory. This suggests a possible persistence method.
